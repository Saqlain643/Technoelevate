str.concat()
	->A concat() method is method to combine two strings.
	->In concat() method, takes only one argument of string and concatenate it with another string.
	->concat() method takes arguments of string type only.
	->concat() takes concatenates two strings and return new string object only string length is greater than 0, otherwise it returns same object.
	->In concat() method raises NullPointer Exception when string is concatenated with null .
	->concat() method is better than + operator because it creates a new object only when the string length is greater than zero(0), so it uses less amount of memory.
	

+ operator
	->+ operator used to concatenate any number of strings.
	->In + operatortakes any number of arguments and combines all strings.
	->+ operator takes any type of argument and converts it to string type and then combine them.
	->+ operatorcreates a new string object every time irrespective of length of string.
	->+ operator concatenates string with without any error.
	->+ operator always a creates a new string irrespective of length of string therefore it takes more memory.
