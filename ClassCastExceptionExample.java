/*
ClassCast Exception in Java is one of the unchecked exceptions that occur when we try to convert one class type object into
another class type.

ClassCast Exception is thrown when we try to cast an object of the parent class to the child class object.
However, it can also be thrown when we try to convert the objects of two individual classes that don't have any relationship
between them.
