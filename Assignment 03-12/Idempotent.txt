An HTTP GET is just for getting things, and it’s not supposed to change anything on the server.
So a GET is, by definition (and according to the HTTP spec) idempotent.
It can be executed more than once without any bad side effects.

POST is not idempotent—the data submitted in the body of a POST might be destined for a transaction that can’t be reversed.
So you have to be careful with your doPost() functionality!
